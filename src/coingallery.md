# Mystery Hunt Coin Gallery

The goal of each Mystery Hunt is to locate an object hidden somewhere on MIT campus. The first few hunts used an [Indian Head Penny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_head_cent), and thus this object has become known as a “coin,” even though not all of them have been actual coins. This gallery contains all the coins from the past hunts that we've been able to track down; if you know of the coins we have marked as “unknown,” or have pictures of coins for which we only have sketches, please [contact us](contact.html).

Rahul Sridhar maintains [a map of where all coins have been found](https://fortenf.org/mh-coin-map/).

_Coin material: gold-plated brass, technique: die stamping, antiquing. Pin material: bronze-plated stamped iron base, technique: soft enamel._

The 2022 Mystery Hunt took place in Bookspace, an interdimensional nexus of all books and all their characters. Teams saw bits of Bookspace flying into the universe through the beginning of the hunt, investigated the causes of Bookspace's gradual destruction, and eventually fixing it. To get home, teams needed to use a tollbooth; but needed to find a coin to use it. The coin was recovered by assembling the team's story of their adventure through Bookspace into a "litcoin". The pin was the reward for finishing the first two "acts" of the hunt.

## 2021

The 2021 Mystery Hunt kicked off with the revelation that MIT Professor Barbara Yew had created a portal to an alternate universe containing the Perpendicular Institute of the World (⊥IW) and had gotten stuck in it. Teams needed to rescue her and fix various problems with the buildings of ⊥IW caused by opening the portal. The coin was a transformed quarter that Professor Yew had left behind in a vending machine in ⊥IW.

The 2020 Mystery Hunt was about Penny Park, a fictional amusement park that had experienced a slow decline.

The coin was a larger pressed penny that was generated by the heart of the park when it was fed all 16 pennies in the final runaround.

The 2019 Mystery Hunt took place on the 100th anniversary of the Great Molasses Flood in Boston. In the opening skit, the writing team decided to create "Molasses Awareness Day", a new holiday commemorating the occasion. Once they did this, disaster struck! In a twist inspired by the movie The Nightmare before Christmas, it was revealed that each holiday exists as a town in the Holiday Forest, and that the molasses from Molasses Awareness Day town was quickly spreading and affecting all the other Holiday towns. Teams needed to find a round manhole cover to plug the hole in the molasses tank. The final coin was formed by punching a small hole in the tank, allowing a small—but safe—drip appropriate for remembering the holiday.

The 2018 Mystery Hunt was themed around the Pixar movie "Inside Out." Solvers were inside of the mind of Ms. Terry Hunter, working to recover the core memories of her four personality islands in order to help her team win their own, fake, mystery hunt. The coin was a new core memory orb that was generated in Terry's mind because her team won Mystery Hunt. The orb was colored yellow (Joy) for the winning team, but colored yellow and blue (Joy and Sadness) for all subsequent teams.

After reconvening in Lobby 7 to put it together, teams learned that the ultimate dreamer was The Alchemist. The coin was found within the Alchemist sculpture by Setec Astronomy at 6:53 PM on Sunday.

Teams needed to explore the depths of the ocean to locate a powerful "Nautilodestone" (the coin!) to harness the power of the "magnetomic-force." Eventually, teams made their way to Atlantis to find that it was completely deserted. After resolving this deeper mystery, teams were given a Navigational Chart which led them to the coin, a real lodestone located in 26-100.

## 2014

_Clock: premade object, coin material: pewter, coin technique: die stamping._

The 2014 hunt asked solvers to hunt down a fearsome beast that escaped from Wonderland to the MIT campus along with a cast of other Wonderland characters. At the end of their quest, the solvers had to close a hole between the two worlds, with the White Rabbit's pocket watch serving as the key. The giant pocket watch depicted above thus served as the coin for this hunt. As a reward for their efforts, the members of the winning team also received souvenir watch-like coins (depicted below the pocketwatch) with pictures of Alice and other Wonderland-related characters and artifacts on one side and a clock with the time set to "20:14" on the other side.

## 2010

![](images/coins/2010.jpg)

_Material: bronze; technique: casting.  
Designed by Mark Halpin_

The 2010 hunt was based on the history of the hunt itself, and a sequence of events that transpired when the coin was hit by Professor Emit's Time Ray and began bouncing back in time, creating new rounds of puzzles and changing history. The two sides of the coin reflect the two parallel Hunt universes: the actual one where Hunt is 30 years old, and the alternate one, where Hunt is 300 years old. The years listed on the alternate universe side refer to the past "hunts" visited during that hunt.

## 2009

![](images/coins/unknown.jpg)

> I recall the coin was an early 1800's british coin perhaps a half crown or half penny featuring King George III. Since he was the King when America won its independence from Britain, He was technically the first King of America. The theme of the whole hunt that year was "search for the King".
