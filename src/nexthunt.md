**_Especially non-students—donate to MIT Puzzle Club:_** If you’re an MIT alum or just love Mystery Hunt, please consider making a donation to Puzzle Club student organization. Puzzle Club hosts puzzling activities year round as well as Hunt, and through your small donations, Puzzle Club and Hunt organizers can focus on Hunt instead of fundraising. To help ensure puzzling and Hunt remain an ongoing MIT tradition, please visit [our MIT donations page](https://giving.mit.edu/form?fundId=2720842) .

For all non-students (including those outside of MIT), we’re happy to hear from you regarding collaboration on events, interest in attending Puzzle Club activities, and other ideas. We are also compiling a list of teams that students can join for hunts throughout the year and would love to add Hunt teams’ contact information. For any of the above, please email us at [puzzle-club-exec@mit.edu](mailto:puzzle-club-exec@mit.edu).

**_Organizations:_** Hunt is also supported by generous corporate sponsors and donors. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please contact [our sponsorship team](mailto:puzzle@mit.edu) .
