# MIT Brass Rat Hunt

The 2027 MIT Brass Rat hunt was a puzzlehunt written for 
[Brass Rat Premiere](https://brassrat.mit.edu),
the annual sophomore class ring event.
The prize for winning was a free class ring.

The hunt took place February 2025; 
note that the title of the hunt refers to the *graduation year*
of the sophomores competing, not the year the hunt was held.
