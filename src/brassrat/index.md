# MIT Brass Rat Hunt

The MIT Brass Rat hunt is a puzzlehunt written for 
[Brass Rat Premiere](https://brassrat.mit.edu),
the annual sophomore class ring event.
The prize for winning is a free class ring.

Starting in 2025, the MIT Puzzle Club writes and runs the
Brass Rat Hunt; previously, it was run by RingComm. 

Note that the titles of the hunts refer to the *graduation year*
of the sophomores competing, not the year the hunt was held.
For instance, the 2027 Brass Rat Hunt was held in February 2025.
