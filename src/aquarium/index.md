# MIT Aquarium Puzzle Hunt

The MIT Aquarium Puzzle Hunt is an annual puzzlehunt written for MIT's incoming first-year undergraduates, intended for solvers with little-to-no experience with puzzles. It takes place on the last day of orientation week at the New England Aquarium.

The hunt began in 2012. From 2012 to 2019, the huntrunners were students associated with Safety Third, a wing in Next House. Since 2021, the MIT Mystery Hunt / Puzzle Club writes and runs the Aquarium Puzzle Hunt.

Are you an MIT student interested in helping with the hunt? We'd always appreciate more help! Check out the [Puzzle Club page](/puzzleclub.html) for more info on joining Puzzle Club.
