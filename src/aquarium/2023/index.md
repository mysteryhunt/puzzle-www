# 2023 Aquarium Puzzle Hunt

## Puzzles

- [All puzzles](all.pdf)

<!-- sorry, no individual pages this time -->

## Simulator

For previous aquarium hunts, teams could text a phone number to submit answers. 
That number is no longer functional, but puzzlers can use the simulator below as a replacement.

To submit an answer, enter it in the format \[puzzle number\] \[puzzle answer\].
For example, if your answer to the fourth puzzle was EXAMPLE,
enter 4 EXAMPLE. For the metapuzzle, use META instead of the puzzle number.
