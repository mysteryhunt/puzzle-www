# 2024 Aquarium Puzzle Hunt

## Puzzles

Note: the final metapuzzle required in-person presence at the aquarium and unfortunately
is unsolvable for remote solvers. We apologize for the inconvenience.

<!-- sorry, no individual pages this time -->

## Simulator

For previous aquarium hunts, teams could text a phone number to submit answers. 
That number is no longer functional, but puzzlers can use the simulator below as a replacement.

To submit an answer, enter it in the format \[researcher last name\] \[puzzle answer\].
For example, if your answer to the puzzle associated with Dr.Basker was EXAMPLE, 
enter BASKER EXAMPLE. For the metapuzzle, use META instead of the researcher's last name.

Note that this year, there was no canonical order to the feeder puzzles, as 
puzzles were scattered around the aquarium for students to find.
