We're planning to have several rounds of competition, each with a variety of logic puzzle genres. If you're unfamiliar with logic puzzles, https://www.gmpuzzles.com/blog/ is a good place to start; it has a long backlog of puzzles, and some of the recent puzzles have solving videos. The list of specific puzzle types in the competition will appear later. Puzzles in the competition are written by puzzle constructors djmathman, jkittykitkat, and ft029.

We're planning the following schedule:

- Round 1: 10 - 10:50

- Lunch Break: 12 - 1
- Round 3: 1 - 1:50
