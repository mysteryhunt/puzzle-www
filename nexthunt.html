<h3>The Next Hunt</h3>

<p>Greetings puzzlers!</p>

<p>
  MIT Puzzle Club and Palindrome are thrilled to announce that the 42nd annual MIT Mystery Hunt will begin at noon ET on Friday, January 14th, 2022. Wrap-up will take place at noon ET on Monday, January 17th, 2022.
</p>
<p>
  Please view our <a href="https://www.mitmh2022.com/">official registration site</a> with more details, and feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:puzzle@mit.edu">puzzle@mit.edu</a> with any additional questions.
</p>

<h3>How to Participate</h3>

<p><b><i>Registration:</i></b> Please view the 
<a href="https://www.mitmh2022.com/">registration website</a> for more details.</p>

<!-- <p><b><i>Registration:</i></b> Mystery Hunt is a team event, so get
your team together and choose a Primary Contact Person to fill out the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpK9PZVk-CUa9eSPcQ8V2mUYS7JdWoESy1MWkV8vGwUX61DA/viewform?usp=sf_link">Team Registration Form</a>.
If you don’t have a team and would like to be matched with one,
please fill out the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqxpDSwrRiljIKef84z8JlTjkW211szs5cw9UvF46j82gMcw/viewform?usp=sf_link">Unattached Hunter Sign Up Form</a>
instead.</p>

<p><b><i>Team Size:</i></b> There is no formal limit on team size but
we recommend you keep your teams to a maximum of 75 people (and, if
you request a team home base through hunt registration, we can only
provide up to two classrooms per team). We will have mechanisms in
place to ensure smaller teams are having fun and making progress, too!</p>

<p>(Concretely: we expect the fastest teams in contention to finish 
first will likely have access to at most 12-15 puzzles at once, and 
experienced teams should take this into account when deciding on team
size to ensure an experience that everyone will enjoy.)</p> -->

<!-- <h3>Accommodations</h3>

<p>As always, Hunt is an MIT event and is best experienced in person
at the Institute. For those who are coming from out of town, we will 
likely arrange discounted room blocks at several local hotels. Details 
will be available as the event becomes closer. -->

<h3>Contribute To Or Be Involved In Mystery Hunt</h3>

<p><b><i>Current MIT Students (undergraduate and graduate):</i></b> Join the student group for Hunt:
Puzzle Club! The group organizes the logistics of Mystery Hunt and also
meets every month or two on campus to do Mystery Hunt-style puzzles
together and eat free food. Help get your fellow students excited about
Hunt. For occasional announcements and info, subscribe to puzzle-club-announce
<a href="https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/puzzle-club-announce">here</a>
. To come to club meeetings and other organizational events, subscribe to puzzle-club 
<a href="https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/puzzle-club">here</a>. With any questions, 
email us at <a href="mailto:puzzle-club-exec@mit.edu">puzzle-club-exec@mit.edu</a>.</p>

<p><b><i>Especially non-students—donate to MIT Puzzle Club:</i></b>
If you’re an MIT alum or just love Mystery Hunt, please consider making
a donation to Puzzle Club student organization. Puzzle Club hosts puzzling
activities year round as well as Hunt, and through your small donations,
Puzzle Club and Hunt organizers can focus on Hunt instead of fundraising.
To help ensure puzzling and Hunt remain an ongoing MIT tradition,
please visit
<a href="https://giving.mit.edu/form?fundId=2720842">our MIT donations page</a>
.</p>
<p>For all non-students (including those outside of MIT), we’re happy to hear from you regarding collaboration on events, 
interest in attending Puzzle Club activities, and other ideas. We are also compiling a list of teams that students 
can join for hunts throughout the year and would love to add Hunt teams’ contact information. For any of the above, 
please email us at <a href="mailto:puzzle-club-exec@mit.edu">puzzle-club-exec@mit.edu</a>.</p>

<p><b><i>Organizations:</i></b> Hunt is also supported by generous corporate
sponsors and donors. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please
contact
<a href="mailto:puzzle@mit.edu">our sponsorship team</a>
.</p>

<!--h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>Many teams have already been formed, but it&rsquo;s not too late to
play! You can either join an existing team that is open to taking on
new members, or you can form a team of your own.</p>

<p><b><i>Join a team:</i></b> The easiest way to do this is to join
the Unattached Hunters list (see below), and we&rsquo;ll work to match
you with the right team. Another option, if you&rsquo;re an MIT
student, is to look for a team that&rsquo;s affiliated with your dorm,
FSILG, club, or department. You can ask around,
or <a href="./contact.html">contact us</a> and we&rsquo;ll help put
you in touch with teams near you.</p>

<p><b><i>Form a team:</i></b> Gather your friends, come up with a
cool team name, and register as a team!  Teams can be any size, but we
recommend at least 6 people and no more than 75. It&rsquo;s too late
this year to request classroom space, but any reasonably private space
&mdash; like a department or dorm lounge &mdash; can make for a great
place to play.</p>

<h3>Team Registration</h3>

<p><b><i>Registration for the 2019 MIT Mystery Hunt:</i></b>
It&rsquo;s time to register teams! Registration is open until
Wednesday, January 16 to get the last stragglers in, but there&rsquo;s
some paperwork to do after you register, so we suggest starting the
process as soon as possible. (Note that the deadline to request
classroom space has passed and we can no longer accommodate requests
for team headquarters space.) Please register (only once per team!)
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4eb4Fo9V51Mtyk4L2" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>As in the past, there is no formal limit on team size, but we
recommend you keep your teams to a maximum of 75 people. The 2019 Hunt
will have mechanisms in place to ensure smaller teams are having fun
and making progress, but if your team is well over 75 strong, you
might have less fun. During the Monsters et Manus Hunt in 2017, some
competitive teams found that they gained access to a large number of
puzzles at once. That will not be the case this year; teams in
contention to finish first will likely have access to at most 12&ndash;15
puzzles at once, and experienced teams should take this into account
when deciding on team size to ensure an experience that everyone will
enjoy.</p>

<h3>Unattached Hunters</h3>

<p>If you would like to participate in Hunt but are not currently a
member of a team, we can help match you up with a team that is
welcoming unattached hunters. Please fill out
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/qHgVipTZ32P4rSWM2" target="_blank">this
form</a>.</p-->
