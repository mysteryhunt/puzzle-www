    <div id="heading">Mystery Hunt Archive</div>
    <p>This archive is a work-in-progress: a few hunts are still missing bits and pieces, and we would like to make them as complete as possible.
       If you have any of the following, please <a href="contact.html">let us know</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2008: The physical exhibit for Dossier 7</li>
      <li>2007: The videos that accompany Metas 2 though 10</li>
      <li>1999: Parts of the Nagoya, Nairobi, and San Francisco puzzles. Solutions to Toronto, Chihuahua, Athens, Colombo, Warrant 3.2, Nagoya, Nairobi, and San Francisco.</li>
      <li>1994-1998: The archivists are currently updating these Hunts with new information. Once this is finished, we will list what we are still missing.</li>
      <li>1993: The computerized portion of the hunt (accessed by "telnet ninja 3051") and all of the solutions.</li>
      <li>1990: Missing everything.</li>
      <li>1988: Missing everything.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
<p>We are also missing solutions for the Chess Competitions and the
hunts from 1981-1983, 1985, and 1989-1992. Additionally, during the
early years of the Mystery Hunt, there were often two simultaneous
hunts (one for individuals and one for teams, or one for small teams
and one for large teams, etc). Since we have no way of knowing which
years had two hunts, the archive may have gaps of which we are
unaware.</p>

<h3>1988</h3>
<!--<p>The 1988 hunt was canceled. In 2014, we received the following note: <blockquote>"I was part of the winning team in 1987 (originally a team of 2, merged into a team of 3, then merged again into about 8 with some really extraordinary solvers including I think Eric Albert).  As part of the tradition that I learned upon winning, I was to set the 1988 hunt.  I applied for the $25 funding from MIT for the reward, put a listing in the IAP guide.  But then I was totally overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task, and also heard from someone else on the team that "someone else was doing it", and so I just canceled it.  (I think I put up a single handwritten poster in Lobby 7.)  I'm *very* glad that this didn't kill the whole thing.  (I believe the ads for 1989 said something like "this one won't be canceled".)  I was a grad student in Math (excuse me, Course XVIII) at the time."</blockquote></p>-->

<h3>Chess Competitions</h3>

<p>Brad Schaefer ran these chess puzzle competitions a couple years before he started the Mystery Hunt. 
You could say they're the grandparents of the Hunt. Or second cousins once removed. Or possibly step-uncles.</p>
